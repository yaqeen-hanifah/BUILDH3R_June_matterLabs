# Build smart contract

This educational journey provided a comprehensive understanding of Ethereum smart contract development, deployment, and interaction. Practical exercises and GitHub updates allowed me to gain hands-on experience and compile a relevant portfolio. I became proficient in creating ERC20 tokens, handling hashed messages on the blockchain, and automating smart contract interactions with ethers.js. Additionally, I investigated zkSync and paymasters for transaction fee handling and token balance management.
