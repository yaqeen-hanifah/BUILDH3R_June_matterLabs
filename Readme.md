## Overview

### The challenge

1. Finish the quickstart session
2. Use GitHub to publish your progress, meaning all the code you learn
3. Write a technical overview of what you learned, share it on your Github as a Readme

## My process

### What I learned

#### Overview
This learning journey has provided a solid foundation in Ethereum smart contract development, deployment, and interaction. By working through practical tasks and publishing progress on GitHub, I've gained hands-on experience and built a portfolio of code that demonstrates my understanding of these concepts.

#### Smart Contracts Created

1. **TestToken.sol**

    - **What I Learned:**
        - How to create an ERC20 token using OpenZeppelin contracts.
        - Using inheritance to extend functionalities with `Ownable` and `ERC20Burnable`.
        - The importance of constructor parameters to initialize the token's name and symbol.
        - How to mint new tokens using a function restricted to the contract owner.

2. **ZeekSecretMessages.sol**


    - **What I Learned:**
        - Creating and managing a list of hashed messages stored on the blockchain.
        - Emitting events to signal the reception of messages.
        - Writing functions to interact with stored data, such as sending messages and counting the total messages.

3. **mint-token.ts**

    - **What I Learned:**
        - Interacting with Ethereum smart contracts using the ethers.js library.
        - Writing scripts to automate token minting and balance checking.
        - Understanding the process of initializing a contract instance and invoking contract functions.

4. **paymaster-transaction.ts**

    - **What I Learned:**
        - Using zkSync and paymasters to handle transaction fees.
        - Integrating with zkSync to send messages and manage token balances.
        - Estimating gas costs and setting up custom transaction parameters.


### Useful resources

- [zksync official docs](https://docs.zksync.io/build/quick-start) - This helped me for creating and deploying the smart contract.
